# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. You may either [open a security advisory](https://github.com/cfsbrands/adp-to-azuread/security/advisories/new) or email **security@cfsbrands.com**. Please do not disclose the issue publicly until we have a chance to investigate and provide a fix.

## Supported Versions

The latest code on the `main` branch receives security updates. Older commits or forks may not be maintained, so we encourage keeping your deployment up to date.

## Response Times

We aim to acknowledge received reports within five business days. After triage, we will work with you to understand the issue and plan for a fix. When a patch is released we will credit those who responsibly disclosed the vulnerability.
